[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/fajsiex/tea-bot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/fajsiex/tea-bot)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FajsiEx/tea-bot.svg?branch=alpha)](https://travis-ci.org/FajsiEx/tea-bot)
![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/FajsiEx/tea-bot.svg)

## Bug reports
1. Look if the issue for it doesn't exist. If it does, don't report it again (duh.)
2. Make an issue.
3. Describe what were you trying to do before the bug occurred (if you found the bug in the code, describe where you found it)

## Features
1. Again, see if the issue for your idea hasn't been made already
2. Make an issue.
3. Describe your idea as detailed as possible. *(please.)*
4. After this 3 things can happen:
   1. I approve and will work on it
   2. I approve, but you must code it yourself
   3. I deny - in which case you shouldn't work on it even if you wanted.

## Contributing
1. Do *not* submit PR before you submit an issue for discussion! Your work may be wasted if you do that (but very rarely)
2. Focus on one feature / bug per PR. It's a pain to review.
3. Pay attention to checks at the bottom! CodeFactor mainly. I don't want unmanageable codebase down the line *`tea-bot-legacy intensifies`*
4. You are good to go! Your PR should be reviewed pretty soon.
