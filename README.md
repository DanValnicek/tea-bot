# Tea-bot
### Just another Discord bot
A lot of things in one bot. Except music. I don't have bw for that.

# Issues / Bug reports
### Found a bug?
1. Look if the issue for it doesn't exist. If it does, don't report it again (duh.)
2. Make an issue that starts with `Bug: `
3. Describe what were you trying to do before the bug occured (if you found the bug in the code, describe where you found it)

### What happened to previous tea-bot?
Well I wasn't happy about how the code works and how unexpandable it was. To change the prefix for example, it would take me going through every sub-module checking/changing code that requires it. I want to have simple, expandable code that doesn't give me headache when I want to change something crucial.

**TL;DR:** Old code bad, new code good.
